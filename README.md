# rsBot
Simple Rs bot I made using python for oldschool runescape

# To Use
Make sure to have the dependencies installed
1. pynput
2. pyscreenshot
3. numpy
4. PIL
5. time
6. datetime

#To start program
python rsBot.py

from there you have a menu of options

To make bot function
1. Calibrate the screen size by placing mouse on the far right of the screen (this can be done from the program menu)
2. Open runescape, and expand the game window to fill the screen
3. Make sure that your display size is set to the static sized version (The left window size option in the in-game settings)
4. In the Dranor Bank, stand in front of the farthest south bank booth
5. Align your camera to look as straight north as possible
6. Zoom in as far as possible
7. Hold the Up arrow key to look straight down over your character
8. Make sure your inventory is empty
9. Select either the willow or the oak setting in the menu
10. Let the bot do its thing
